        <h2>Future Computer Engineer</h2>
        <p>Hello, I am Cris Daniel Gurieza, or just "Daniel" for short. I am currently situated in Malolos, Bulacan,
          Philippines and studying computer engineering in Bulacan State University.</p>

        <p>I aspire to graduate and work as a professional in the field of computers because of my love for technology
          itself, but am also a frustrated YouTuber and streamer. So, if life gives the means to do those in the future,
          I would definitely grab them.</p>

          <h2>Anime</h2>
          <p>I love anime! It is not because I am childish, but because I appreciate the media itself and the
            technicalities behind it especially when they often give you enexpected life lessons, and sometimes
            depression. In fact, I loved anime even before I learned how to use a phone, and I want to revive a "dead"
            anime YouTube channel of mine when I have the chance. Yes, I am and will always be, a weeb. And I am proud
            of it. </p>

          <h2>Games</h2>
          <p>Boy, oh boy. How I miss those childhood days where I could play on a Play Station 2 or a gameboy with
            friends almost all day without someone getting angry at me. I have considered myelf a gamer eversince I have
            known and played Tetris. And until know, the desire to play, and even stream, is still in me. But the time
            to do so is not, more often than I would like.</p>

          <h2>Cars</h2>
          <p>Maybe it is because I am a son of a driver, but there is something about cars that really draw me in. I
            admire those beast machines for their beauty and horsepower and I show it through gaining knowledge about as
            many cars as I can, playing racing games, and even collecting mini replicas.</p>

          <h2>Audiophilia</h2>
          <p>Eversince knowing about the existance of uncompressed audio files back in 2018, I have been diving head
            first into the vast sea of information about high-quality audio and the equipments tied to it. Right now I
            only have shelf speakers, a portable bluetooth speaker, a set of true wireless earphones, 50 gigabytes worth
            of FLAC files, and the knowledge about audio I have been binging on, but I will definitely live the real
            audiophile life in the future. For now, I won't even look at the price tags of those equipments.

            <p>As a group project, we basically embed a timer into the circuit of a charger that will alllow the user to set a custom time for the charger to turn off. This targets the problem and fear of overcharging gadgets especially when left charging unattended whether intentional or not.</p>

            <p>Though it is a simple activity in one of my major subjects, i really enjoyed my time building this circuit, because it is one of the seldom times during the pandemic that I was actually able to put practical skills to use and build something physically with my hands. Still looking for a nice casing to turn this into a trinket in my room that i can use when I want.</p>

            <p>The pandemic rendered us students unable to attend class physically. So to adapt to the situation, we still studied network configuration albeit virtually. Although hands-on activities were not available, i still enjoyed learning about networks.</p>

            <p>Just like other hands-on activities halted because of the pandemic, we also did Arduino programming virtually through Tinkercad. We did basic things and made various circuits using arduino and some other components like LED lights, buzzers, etc.</p>
